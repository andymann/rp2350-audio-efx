/*
 * dac_hw_mute.h — Hardware mute pin support for I²S DACs.
 *
 * Drives a configurable GPIO line that connects to a DAC chip's
 * dedicated MUTE input (e.g. PCM5102A XSMT, WM8741 MUTEB, AK4493
 * SMUTE).  The pin is asserted before pipeline reset stops the I²S
 * bit clock and LR clock, giving the DAC time to ramp its analog
 * output to silence under its own internal control.  Without this,
 * the DAC sees BCK/LRCLK abruptly cease mid-cycle and its analog
 * output DC-steps, producing an audible thump on input-source
 * switches, preset loads, and other lifecycle events that disable
 * the I²S state machine.
 *
 * SCOPE: hardware pin only.  DACs without a dedicated mute pin (ES9038
 * family, CS43198, modern AKM with register-only mute) are explicitly
 * out of scope — those chips ship with internal soft-mute and
 * Popguard-style protection that mitigates the same problem from the
 * chip side.  Supporting register-based mute would require an I²C/SPI
 * bus driver, per-chip register tables, and chip detection, which is
 * disproportionate to the benefit.
 *
 * INTEGRATION SEAMS (main.c):
 *   - core0_init() → dac_hw_mute_init(&dir_cache.dac_hw_mute) once
 *     after preset_boot_load() so the loaded config applies at boot.
 *   - prepare_pipeline_reset() → dac_hw_mute_assert() AFTER the
 *     software fade has actually reached silence on the wire (and
 *     likewise in the pipeline_reset_ready() gate, which fades first
 *     and asserts second).  Asserting at full level would truncate the
 *     fade this mute exists to cover and re-expose the step on release.
 *     assert() is non-blocking; it drives the pin and arms a hold
 *     deadline only.
 *   - The hold is enforced by the caller, non-blockingly: the main loop
 *     defers the clock-stopping work (complete_pipeline_reset() teardown,
 *     process_type_switches(), or drain_and_disable_outputs()) until
 *     dac_hw_mute_hold_elapsed() returns true, so audio keeps draining
 *     during the hold instead of busy-waiting.
 *   - complete_pipeline_reset() → dac_hw_mute_release() AFTER the
 *     synchronized PIO SM start so the DAC sees clocks restarted
 *     before the mute pin is deasserted.  If release_ms is non-zero,
 *     the pin remains asserted until dac_hw_mute_tick() reaches the
 *     release deadline.
 *
 * ZERO-COST WHEN DISABLED: every public entry point early-exits if
 * cfg.enabled == 0.  The audio-path inner loops never call this
 * module — all work happens in the deferred pipeline-reset block
 * which only fires on lifecycle events.  Steady-state audio
 * performance is byte-for-byte identical to a build with this module
 * removed.
 *
 * THREAD MODEL: all entry points are main-thread.  No ISR access, no
 * cross-core access.  GPIO state writes are non-atomic relative to
 * the audio path but the audio path never reads them.  Configuration
 * struct is a plain global, not volatile.
 *
 * See Documentation/Features/dac_hardware_mute_spec.md for the full
 * design rationale, verified DAC mute timings, and persistence model.

 * Per-installation configuration.  Wire/flash-stable 16-byte layout.

 *
 * Single shared GPIO drives the DAC's MUTE input.  This is the only
 * topology the firmware needs to support: the pipeline-reset path is
 * a global event that disables and re-enables ALL output slots
 * together — there is never a moment when one slot's I²S clocks are
 * stopping while another's are running.  So a per-slot mute array
 * would be over-engineering with no behavioural benefit.
