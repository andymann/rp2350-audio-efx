/*
 * dac_hw_mute.c — Hardware mute pin support for I²S DACs.
 *
 * See dac_hw_mute.h for the public API and
 * Documentation/Features/dac_hardware_mute_spec.md for the design.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *
 *   - All state is plain (non-volatile).  Every public entry point
 *     runs on the main thread; no ISR access.  GPIO writes use the
 *     SDK's gpio_put() which compiles to a single SIO register
 *     store — atomic on both Cortex-M0+ and M33.
 *
 *   - "Un-muted level" is the polarity-inverse of "muted level":
 *     active_low=1 → un-muted = HIGH, muted = LOW; active_low=0 →
 *     un-muted = LOW, muted = HIGH.  Pins are driven to the un-muted
 *     level the moment they are claimed (gpio_init + set_dir), so
 *     there is no audible mute pulse during normal init.
 *
 *   - Pin release on config change drives the pin to high-Z input
 *     before re-init, not to a "safe" level — the GPIO is no longer
 *     owned by this module and may be repurposed by another
 *     subsystem.  Driving a level would briefly assert mute on a
 *     freshly-released pin which is wasteful.
 *
 *   - The pre-clock-stop hold is asynchronous: dac_hw_mute_assert()
 *     drives the pin to muted and records a deadline (s_lifecycle_hold_us)
 *     but does NOT wait.  The caller polls dac_hw_mute_hold_elapsed() from
 *     the main loop and only stops the output clocks once it returns true,
 *     so audio servicing (USB ring drain, SPDIF poll) keeps running while
 *     the DAC's analog stage ramps down.  A blocking busy-wait here would
 *     stall the main loop — starving the SPDIF in-to-out path and delaying
 *     boot-into-SPDIF / input-source switches by up to hold_ms.
 *
 *   - The post-clock-restart release hold is asynchronous in the same way:
 *     the mute pin remains asserted, a deadline is recorded, and the main-
 *     loop dac_hw_mute_tick() deasserts later.  This keeps the SPDIF
 *     in-to-out path draining while the external DAC remains muted.
 *
 *   - Persistence is via flash_storage.c's directory cache.  This
 *     module does not directly touch flash — dac_hw_mute_set_config()
 *     writes the in-RAM dir_cache and triggers a deferred flash
 *     write via flash_storage_mark_directory_dirty() (the same
 *     mechanism master volume mode and include_pins use).
