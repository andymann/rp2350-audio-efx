/*
 * lg_sound_sync.c — LG Sound Sync (optical) protocol decoder.
 *
 * See lg_sound_sync.h and Documentation/Features/lg_sound_sync_spec.md
 * for the protocol description and design rationale.  This file is a
 * straight implementation of §4 (Architecture) and §5 (Detection State
 * Machine) of that spec.
 *
 * Architecture summary:
 *   - One periodic tick (~50 ms) reads the locked SPDIF channel-status
 *     bytes and looks for a fixed 5-nibble LG signature.
 *   - Asymmetric hysteresis (3-poll rise, 10-poll fall) absorbs lock
 *     transients and bit errors without dropping vol_mul mid-listening.
 *   - On PRESENT, the decoded volume/mute is funneled through
 *     apply_vol_index_to_audio() — the same helper used by the USB host
 *     volume path — so loudness compensation tracks LG-driven changes.
 *   - On ABSENT (transition from PRESENT), vol_mul is restored to the
 *     value it would have had under USB-host control: the cached
 *     audio_state.volume mapped through the same arithmetic that
 *     audio_set_volume() uses.
 *
 * Concurrency:
 *   - All public entry points run on the main thread.  vol_mul writes
 *     are not torn-read-safe by themselves on RP2040 (16-bit field,
 *     single store per architecture), but the audio pipeline only
 *     samples vol_mul at packet boundaries through a per-packet ramp,
 *     so a brief inconsistency cannot produce a discontinuity.
 *   - Status reads (lg_sound_sync_get_status) snapshot via a small IRQ-
 *     disabled critical section so the host sees a coherent struct.
