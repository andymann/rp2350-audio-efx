/*
 * lg_sound_sync.h — LG Sound Sync (optical) protocol decoder.
 *
 * LG TVs broadcast their volume and mute state in specific channel-status
 * bytes of the SPDIF (TOSLINK) stream they output.  When this feature is
 * enabled and an LG-Sound-Sync-marked SPDIF source is locked, this module
 * drives the device's host volume + loudness coefficients from the LG-
 * decoded values, so the TV remote acts as a volume control for DSPi.
 *
 * The protocol is observation-only — there is no back-channel; we just
 * watch the channel-status for a fixed signature and decode the volume
 * out of nibbles 30..31 + 32..35 of the 192-bit channel-status field.
 *
 * Why is this here and not in spdif_input.c?
 *   - spdif_input.c owns the RX hardware lifecycle (start/stop, FIFO
 *     drain, clock servo, lock state).  Coupling control-side decoding
 *     into it would make it harder to reason about either piece.
 *   - Different external sources can drive the same logical "TV remote
 *     controls device volume" abstraction (LG today, Samsung/Sony in
 *     future).  Keeping this in its own module lets us add per-protocol
 *     decoders without touching the audio path.
 *
 * Why does it drive host volume rather than master volume?
 *   - Loudness compensation tracks the *raw user-perceived* volume index
 *     (the same one db_to_vol[] indexes).  Master volume is a separate
 *     ceiling that does not feed loudness.  If LG vol drove master
 *     instead, lowering the TV vol would reduce SPL but loudness would
 *     keep its EQ at the original reference, over-compensating bass and
 *     treble.  Driving host volume keeps the SPL/loudness loop coherent.
 *
 * See Documentation/Features/lg_sound_sync_spec.md for the full design,
 * protocol details, and edge-case matrix.
