# External Control Interfaces (UART and I2C Target)

*Firmware wire-protocol version: 1*

This document is the complete, self-contained specification for driving a DSPi
from an external microcontroller over UART or over the I2C target (slave)
interface. It is written for a firmware integrator building an ESP32, STM32,
Arduino, or SBC controller; no DSPi source is required to implement a client.

Writing style note: this doc avoids em-dashes per project convention.

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 One command surface, three transports

DSPi exposes a single vendor-command surface. Historically it was reachable only
over USB (EP0 vendor control transfers). It is now also reachable over two
external transports through a transport-neutral orchestrator inside the firmware:

- **USB** (`CTRL_SOURCE_USB`): the original EP0 path.
- **UART** (`CTRL_SOURCE_UART`): an asynchronous serial link, 3.3V logic.
- **I2C target** (`CTRL_SOURCE_I2C`): the device acts as an I2C slave; an
  external controller is the bus master.

Every transport parses its own wire framing into the same
`bRequest` / `wValue` / `wIndex` / `wLength` shape and hands it to the same
dispatcher (`vendor_dispatch_get` / `vendor_dispatch_set`). The consequence that
matters most for integrators:

> **Full parity.** Every vendor command works identically over USB, UART, and
> I2C: EQ, matrix routing, presets, master volume, input selection, the bulk
> get/set of all parameters (`0xA0` / `0xA1`), and even bootloader entry
> (`0xF0`). Any command added to the firmware in the future is automatically
> available on all three transports with nothing per-transport to implement.

The full opcode catalogue lives in `Documentation/commands.md`. This spec covers
only the framing, status, and behavior that are specific to the external
transports.

### 1.2 The one exception: USB-only self-configuration

Two commands are refused on the external transports:

| Command | Code | Meaning |
|---------|------|---------|
| `REQ_SET_UART_CONFIG` | `0xF5` | Configure the UART control interface |
| `REQ_SET_I2C_CONFIG`  | `0xF7` | Configure the I2C control interface |

An attempt to send either of these over UART or I2C is rejected with a
`BLOCKED` status (never applied). This is deliberate: an external controller can
read the interface config (`0xF6` / `0xF8`) and status (`0xF9`), but it can never
reconfigure, move the pins of, change the baud/address of, or disable the very
transport it is talking on. It cannot lock itself out. Interface configuration
is a one-time setup step performed over USB.

Everything else, including the two GET-config commands and the status readback,
is available on every transport.

### 1.3 Ship state

Both interfaces ship **disabled** by default. A fresh device (or one after a
factory reset) has no UART or I2C control activity and holds none of their pins.
A one-time USB setup enables and pins each interface; the choice persists across
reboots and survives factory reset.

---

## 2. Configuration over USB

Configuration is done with five vendor commands. All five are reachable over
USB; only the two GETs and the status readback are reachable over UART/I2C.

| Command | Code | Dir | Payload / Response |
|---------|------|-----|--------------------|
| `REQ_SET_UART_CONFIG`       | `0xF5` | OUT | 8-byte `UartCtrlConfig` (USB only) |
| `REQ_GET_UART_CONFIG`       | `0xF6` | IN  | 8-byte `UartCtrlConfig` (live) |
| `REQ_SET_I2C_CONFIG`        | `0xF7` | OUT | 8-byte `I2cCtrlConfig` (USB only) |
| `REQ_GET_I2C_CONFIG`        | `0xF8` | IN  | 8-byte `I2cCtrlConfig` (live) |
| `REQ_GET_CTRL_IFACE_STATUS` | `0xF9` | IN  | 8-byte `CtrlIfaceStatus` |

### 2.1 Structures

All fields little-endian, packed, no padding.

```c
// UART control interface configuration (8 bytes).  Framing is fixed 8N1
// (the wire CRC16 covers integrity, so parity adds nothing); the baud rate
// and the notify_enable flag are configurable.  notify_enable claims the
// byte that was formerly reserved; every stored or wired config predating it
// carries 0 there, so notifications default off with no directory version
// bump and no change to the 8-byte wire layout.
typedef struct __attribute__((packed)) {
    uint8_t  enabled;       // 0 = off, 1 = on
    uint8_t  tx_pin;        // GPIO carrying a UARTx TX mux; pin % 4 == 0
    uint8_t  rx_pin;        // GPIO carrying a UARTx RX mux; pin % 4 == 1, same instance
    uint8_t  notify_enable; // 0 = off (default), 1 = push type-0x40 notification frames (see 3.6)
    uint32_t baud;          // 9600 .. 1000000
} UartCtrlConfig;

// I2C target control interface configuration (8 bytes).  Bus speed and
// clock-stretch behavior are controller-side properties for a target and
// are not stored here.
typedef struct __attribute__((packed)) {
    uint8_t  enabled;   // 0 = off, 1 = on
    uint8_t  sda_pin;   // GPIO carrying an I2Cx SDA mux; pin % 2 == 0
    uint8_t  scl_pin;   // GPIO carrying an I2Cx SCL mux; pin % 2 == 1, same instance
    uint8_t  address;   // 7-bit target address, 0x08 .. 0x77
    uint8_t  reserved[4];
} I2cCtrlConfig;

// REQ_GET_CTRL_IFACE_STATUS response (8 bytes).
typedef struct __attribute__((packed)) {
    uint8_t uart_last_status; // PIN_CONFIG_* from the last REQ_SET_UART_CONFIG
    uint8_t uart_live;        // 1 if the UART peripheral is up and listening
    uint8_t i2c_last_status;  // PIN_CONFIG_* from the last REQ_SET_I2C_CONFIG
    uint8_t i2c_live;         // 1 if the I2C target is up and listening
    uint8_t proto_version;    // external wire-protocol version, currently 1
    uint8_t reserved[3];      // 0
} CtrlIfaceStatus;
```

Both interfaces are pin-constrained by the RP2040/RP2350 GPIO mux: a UART TX pin
must be a GPIO whose function-2 mux is that UART instance's TX (`pin % 4 == 0`),
its RX pin must be the same instance's RX (`pin % 4 == 1`); an I2C SDA pin must be
even and its SCL pin the next odd GPIO on the same I2C instance. The firmware
validates this at apply time.

### 2.2 Defaults

Populated on fresh flash, on the V5-to-V6 directory migration, and whenever a
stored config fails a bounds check on load.

| Field | UART default | I2C default |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| enabled | 0 (off) | 0 (off) |
| TX / SDA pin | GPIO 16 | GPIO 18 |
| RX / SCL pin | GPIO 17 | GPIO 19 |
| baud | 115200 | n/a |
| address | n/a | 0x42 |

Baud range: 9600 .. 1000000. I2C address range: 0x08 .. 0x77 (7-bit).

### 2.3 Status codes returned by the SET commands

`REQ_SET_UART_CONFIG` / `REQ_SET_I2C_CONFIG` validate and apply, returning a
1-byte `PIN_CONFIG_*` code (shared with the S/PDIF, I2S, and MCK pin commands):

| Code | Name | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| `0x00` | `PIN_CONFIG_SUCCESS` | Applied and persisted |
| `0x01` | `PIN_CONFIG_INVALID_PIN` | A pin is out of range or lacks the required mux function |
| `0x02` | `PIN_CONFIG_PIN_IN_USE` | A pin is already claimed by an output, RX, MCK, DAC-mute, or the other control interface |
| `0x05` | `PIN_CONFIG_INVALID_PARAM` | A non-pin field is out of range (baud below 9600 / above 1000000, or I2C address outside 0x08..0x77) |

The same code is echoed back in `CtrlIfaceStatus.uart_last_status` /
`i2c_last_status` so a controller (or a later boot) can read the last outcome.

### 2.4 Apply and persist semantics

A `REQ_SET_*_CONFIG` over USB is accepted in the USB ISR but the real work is
**deferred to the main loop**, because it touches GPIO/IRQ state and, on success,
writes flash. The main loop does, in order:

1. **Live apply.** Tear down the current interface first (so its own pins are not
   seen as in-use), then validate the new config and, if valid and enabled, bring
   the peripheral up on the new pins. On a validation failure the previous config
   is restored best-effort and the interface is left as it was.
2. **Persist only on success.** The new config is written to the preset directory
   **only when the live apply returned `PIN_CONFIG_SUCCESS`**. A rejected SET
   never clobbers a good stored config.

Because the persist is a flash write, expect the usual ~45 ms interrupt blackout
(see 5.2). Interface config is device-level, not part of any preset slot and not
part of `WireBulkParams`; the bulk wire-format version is unchanged by this
feature.

### 2.5 Notification to the USB host

Configuration is done over USB, so the host already knows it happened. Separately,
when a control command arriving over UART or I2C changes a parameter, the device
emits its normal change notification to the USB host (notification endpoint) with
a source tag identifying the transport:

| Source tag | Value |
|------------|-------|
| `PARAM_SRC_UART` | 8 |
| `PARAM_SRC_I2C`  | 9 |

A USB host monitoring the notification endpoint therefore sees changes made by an
external controller, correctly attributed.

### 2.6 Boot behavior

At boot, after the preset directory is loaded, the firmware reads the persisted
`UartCtrlConfig` / `I2cCtrlConfig` and brings each enabled interface up. Bring-up
happens **after** the output, RX, MCK, and DAC-mute pins are claimed, so a stored
control config whose pins now collide with the current output wiring is quietly
kept **down**: `enabled` stays 1 in the stored config, but the peripheral does not
start and `CtrlIfaceStatus.*_live` reads 0. The host can detect this divergence by
comparing the config's `enabled` against the live flag from `0xF9`.

---

## 3. UART Transport

### 3.1 Electrical and link parameters

- **Logic level:** 3.3V. Do not drive the RX pin above 3.3V; level-shift a 5V host.
- **Framing:** fixed **8N1** (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit). Parity is
  intentionally not offered; the wire CRC16 provides integrity end to end.
- **Baud:** configurable 9600 .. 1000000; default 115200.
- **Direction:** full duplex. The protocol is request/response, with one
  optional exception: when notifications are enabled the device may also send
  unsolicited notification frames at frame boundaries while the link is idle
  (see 3.6).

### 3.2 Frame formats

Every frame begins with the sync byte `0xA5` followed by a type byte. All
multi-byte fields are little-endian. `bReq` is the vendor command ID; `wVal`,
`wIdx`, `wLen` are the 16-bit request fields.

```
Request SET   (host -> device):
  A5 01 bReq wValL wValH wIdxL wIdxH wLenL wLenH  payload[wLen]  crcL crcH

Request GET   (host -> device):
  A5 02 bReq wValL wValH wIdxL wIdxH wLenL wLenH                 crcL crcH
      (no payload; wLen caps the response size, 0 = full/uncapped)

Response SET  (device -> host):
  A5 81 status lenL lenH                                          crcL crcH
      (len is always 0)

Response GET  (device -> host):
  A5 82 status lenL lenH payload[len]                             crcL crcH
      (payload present only when status == OK)

Notification (device -> host):
  A5 40 00 lenL lenH packet[len]                                  crcL crcH
      (device-initiated; byte 2 is a fixed 0x00 status placeholder;
       `packet` is a verbatim v2 notify packet; see 3.6)
```

Type byte summary:

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0x01` | SET request |
| `0x02` | GET request |
| `0x40` | Device-initiated notification (opt-in; see 3.6) |
| `0x81` | SET response |
| `0x82` | GET response |

Any unrecognized type byte, or bytes seen while not synced, are treated as noise
and dropped; the parser resynchronizes on the next `0xA5`.

`wIdx` is passed straight through to the dispatcher. Over USB it carries the
vendor interface number (2); over UART it is not an interface selector and can be
sent as `0x0000` for every command except those few that genuinely use `wIndex`
as a parameter. `wValue` still carries per-command data (channel, slot, packed
fields) exactly as over USB.

### 3.3 CRC16 details

- **Algorithm:** CRC16-CCITT-FALSE.
- **Polynomial:** `0x1021`.
- **Initial value:** `0xFFFF`.
- **No input reflection, no output reflection, no final XOR.**
- **Coverage:** every byte **after** the sync byte, i.e. the type byte through the
  last payload byte inclusive. The sync byte `0xA5` is **not** included.
- **On the wire:** transmitted little-endian (low byte first, then high byte).
- Accumulated incrementally byte by byte in both directions.

Reference check: CRC16-CCITT-FALSE over the ASCII string `123456789` is `0x29B1`.
Use this to validate a client implementation before wiring it to hardware.

### 3.4 Status codes (response byte)

Byte 0 of every SET/GET response payload area (the `status` field) is one of the
shared `CTRL_STATUS_*` codes:

| Code | Name | Meaning / client action |
|------|------|-------------------------|
| `0x00` | `CTRL_STATUS_OK` | Success. On a GET, `len` bytes of payload follow. |
| `0x01` | `CTRL_STATUS_BUSY` | The device could not service the request yet (a USB control SET was in flight). Retry the whole request shortly. |
| `0x02` | `CTRL_STATUS_ERROR` | Unknown command or a bad parameter; the handler rejected it. |
| `0x03` | `CTRL_STATUS_BLOCKED` | USB-only command (`0xF5` / `0xF7`) attempted over this transport. |
| `0x04` | `CTRL_STATUS_BULK_LOCKED` | The shared bulk buffer is owned by another transport. Retry shortly. |
| `0x05` | `CTRL_STATUS_CRC_ERROR` | The request failed CRC16; it was not dispatched. Resend. |
| `0x06` | `CTRL_STATUS_OVERSIZE` | A non-bulk payload exceeded 64 bytes. |
| `0x07` | `CTRL_STATUS_FRAME_ERROR` | The frame was malformed or truncated. |

### 3.5 Timing, timeouts, and the one-request-in-flight rule

- **One request in flight.** Send one request, wait for its response, then send
  the next. The device parses, dispatches from the main loop, and replies; it
  does not queue pipelined requests. Overlapping requests is undefined.
- **Dispatch happens from the main loop**, not the ISR. The ISR only moves bytes
  into a ring; nothing here ever blocks or busy-waits, and the audio pipeline is
  never touched. Response latency is therefore one main-loop iteration under
  normal conditions, longer if a flash write is in progress.
- **Timeouts.** Use generous per-request timeouts. During a flash write the
  device is deaf for ~45 ms with interrupts off; inbound UART bytes sent in that
  window can be lost (see 5.2). A robust client uses a timeout of at least a few
  hundred milliseconds and retries on timeout or on `BUSY` / `BULK_LOCKED` / a
  CRC error.

### 3.6 Asynchronous notifications

The device can push change/event notifications to the UART controller without
polling, using frame type `0x40`. This mirrors the USB interrupt/notification
endpoint (EP 0x83): a UART client can track parameter changes, preset loads, and
input-format changes live instead of re-reading GET commands on a timer.

**Enabling.** Notifications are opt-in via the `notify_enable` byte of
`UartCtrlConfig` (0 = off, the default; 1 = on). Like all interface
configuration, `notify_enable` is set over USB only (`REQ_SET_UART_CONFIG`,
`0xF5`); it cannot be changed over the UART link itself. See 2.1.

**Frame.** A notification frame is `A5 40 00 lenL lenH packet[len] crcL crcH`.
Byte 2 is a fixed `0x00` placeholder in the status slot (there is no status on a
device-initiated frame). `packet` is the **verbatim v2 notify packet**, byte for
byte the same payload the USB notification endpoint delivers; parse it exactly as
described in `Documentation/Features/notification_protocol_v2_spec.md`. The v1
legacy master-volume packet is **never** sent over UART; every v1 event has a v2
twin, so a UART client sees the v2 `PARAM_CHANGED` for master volume instead.

**Idle-priority rule.** A notification frame is emitted only at a frame boundary
while the link is otherwise idle (no response is being sent and no request is
being parsed or dispatched), so a notification **never splits or delays a
response**; request/response traffic always takes precedence. A notification may
therefore appear at any point between frames. A client that streams requests
back to back can starve notifications indefinitely; that is intentional and the
seq-gap recovery contract below covers it.

**Recovery contract.** Every v2 packet carries an 8-bit `seq` byte that
increments per notification for this consumer. A **gap** in `seq` (a jump larger
than 1, accounting for the wrap at 256) means one or more events were dropped for
this consumer; recover by issuing a full `REQ_GET_ALL_PARAMS` (`0xA0`) to re-sync
state. Drops happen when the device produces events faster than a starved or slow
UART consumer drains them; the ring force-drops the consumer's oldest entry to
keep the producer and other consumers moving, and the seq gap is how the client
detects it.

A client that does not enable notifications simply never sees a `0x40` frame and
polls the relevant GET commands for state, exactly as before. A
forward-compatible client that leaves notifications off should still treat a
stray `0xA5 0x40 ...` frame as "ignore" rather than a protocol error.

### 3.7 Bulk transfer notes (0xA0 / 0xA1)

`REQ_GET_ALL_PARAMS` (`0xA0`) and `REQ_SET_ALL_PARAMS` (`0xA1`) move the entire
`WireBulkParams` blob (roughly 3.7 KB; exact size is the wire-format version's
anchor) in a single framed transfer, with the whole payload carried in one GET
response / one SET request payload. These are large; budget the wire time:

| Baud | Approx. time for a ~3.7 KB bulk frame (8N1, ~10 bits/byte) |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 9600 | ~3.8 s |
| 115200 | ~0.32 s |
| 460800 | ~0.08 s |
| 1000000 | ~0.037 s |

For interactive control prefer the targeted per-parameter commands; use bulk only
for a full snapshot/restore. The bulk buffer is a single shared resource across
USB/UART/I2C; if another transport holds it you get `BULK_LOCKED` and should
retry. Run bulk transfers at a high baud rate to keep the buffer-hold window
short.

---

## 4. I2C Transport

### 4.1 Electrical and bus parameters

- **Role:** target (slave) only. The DSPi never initiates bus traffic; an
  external controller is always the master. There is consequently **no
  asynchronous notification channel on I2C** (that requires the target to
  initiate a transfer, which it cannot): an I2C controller stays **poll-only**
  and re-reads the relevant GET commands for state. The `0x40` notification
  frame (3.6) is UART-only. A poll-based notification drain is the first
  planned use of the reserved read-channel-select verbs; see the reserved
  write-frame types note in 4.2.
- **Addressing:** 7-bit. Configurable address 0x08 .. 0x77; default 0x42.
- **Speed:** up to **400 kHz** (Fast-mode). The device does not restrict the SCL
  rate itself; keep the master at or below 400 kHz.
- **Pull-ups:** the device enables the pad's weak internal pull-ups as a safety
  net, but they are too weak for reliable bus edges. Fit proper **external
  pull-ups** (typically 2.2k .. 4.7k to 3.3V) sized for your bus capacitance and
  speed.
- **Logic level:** 3.3V.

### 4.2 Frame formats

A request is a single I2C **write** transaction: an 8-byte header, optionally
followed by the SET payload. All multi-byte fields little-endian.

```
Request (I2C write):
  [type][bReq][wValL][wValH][wIdxL][wIdxH][wLenL][wLenH][payload...]
    type 0x01 = SET  (payload of wLen bytes follows the header)
    type 0x02 = GET  (no payload; wLen caps the response size, 0 = full)
```

A response is read back with one or more I2C **read** transactions:

```
Response (I2C read):
  [status][lenL][lenH][payload...]   then 0xFF padding beyond the response end
    status is a CTRL_STATUS_* code (same table as UART, section 3.4)
    len is 0 unless status == OK on a GET
```

There is no sync byte and no CRC on I2C; the bus provides framing and ACK-level
integrity. The header layout matches the UART frame body (type through wLen), so
the same request-builder code can serve both transports.

**Reserved write-frame types (0x03 and above).** Only `0x01` and `0x02` are
defined at protocol version 1. Every other type value is reserved for future
read-channel-select verbs: a write frame whose verb, instead of carrying a
request, selects which logical read channel subsequent I2C read transactions
drain. The read frame layout above carries no type byte by design; under this
register-pointer model (the classic I2C idiom: write a pointer, then read) the
controller always knows what it selected, so the read layout never needs to
change. Today there is exactly one implicit channel, the response to the most
recent request, and that remains the default forever: clients that never send
a select verb are unaffected by any future extension. Planned semantics for
when channels are added: a normal SET/GET request write resets the selection
back to the response channel (its whole purpose is to read its own reply); a
select verb persists until the next select or request. The first anticipated
channel is a notification drain, giving I2C poll-based delivery of the same
v2 notification packets UART carries in its type `0x40` frames.

Current firmware rejects any write frame with an unknown type byte by parking
a `CTRL_STATUS_FRAME_ERROR` response, so a client probing for a verb the
device does not implement gets a clean, detectable refusal. When new verbs
are introduced, `CtrlIfaceStatus.proto_version` (command `0xF9`) will be
bumped; gate any use of types 0x03+ on reading a version above 1.

### 4.3 The BUSY-retry pattern and repeated-START

Request dispatch runs from the main loop, so a read issued **before** the main
loop has processed the request finds no response ready. In that case the device
returns a BUSY frame:

```
  [0x01, 0x00, 0x00]   (status = CTRL_STATUS_BUSY, len = 0)
```

The controller simply retries the read a moment later.

- **With repeated-START** (write header, repeated-START, read in one combined
  transaction): the first read typically lands in the BUSY window and returns the
  BUSY frame; a follow-up read (or a short delay then read) returns the real
  response.
- **Without repeated-START** (separate write then read transactions): issue the
  write, wait briefly, then read; if you get BUSY, poll the read until the status
  is no longer BUSY.

Either way, treat `status == 0x01` as "not ready, read again".

### 4.4 Chunked, resumable reads

The parked response survives across multiple read transactions until it is fully
consumed. A controller that cannot read the whole response in one transaction
(small FIFO, or no repeated-START) can read it in chunks: successive reads
continue where the previous one left off, and once the payload is exhausted the
device returns `0xFF` padding. Reading past the end is safe and simply yields
`0xFF`.

Starting a **new request write discards any unconsumed response**. Finish reading
a response before issuing the next request.

### 4.5 Clock stretching

The device stretches the clock only briefly, bounded to ISR latency at I2C FIFO
boundaries. It **never** stretches while waiting on application state; that is
exactly what the BUSY frame is for. A controller therefore never sees an
unbounded stretch waiting on DSP or flash work.

### 4.6 Bulk transfer notes (0xA0 / 0xA1)

Bulk get/set works over I2C too. A large GET response (~3.7 KB) is read out in
chunks per 4.4; a large SET is written as one long header+payload transaction (or
as your master's max-transfer chunks if it fragments writes). At 400 kHz a ~3.7 KB
transfer is on the order of ~80 ms of bus time plus per-transaction overhead. The
same shared-buffer lock applies: a `BULK_LOCKED` status means another transport
holds the buffer; retry. During a flash write an in-progress I2C transaction can
stall; use generous timeouts and retry (see 5.2).

---

## 5. Shared Behavior

### 5.1 CTRL_STATUS codes (both transports)

The `status` byte in every UART and I2C response uses the same set:

| Code | Name |
|------|------|
| `0x00` | `CTRL_STATUS_OK` |
| `0x01` | `CTRL_STATUS_BUSY` |
| `0x02` | `CTRL_STATUS_ERROR` |
| `0x03` | `CTRL_STATUS_BLOCKED` |
| `0x04` | `CTRL_STATUS_BULK_LOCKED` |
| `0x05` | `CTRL_STATUS_CRC_ERROR` (UART only in practice; I2C has no CRC) |
| `0x06` | `CTRL_STATUS_OVERSIZE` |
| `0x07` | `CTRL_STATUS_FRAME_ERROR` |

**What `OK` means on a SET.** `CTRL_STATUS_OK` confirms the frame was valid
and the command was dispatched; it does not certify the parameter was
applied. A recognized command whose payload fails the handler's own
validation (too short, value out of range, invalid channel index) is
silently ignored, exactly as it is over USB, and still answers `OK`.
`CTRL_STATUS_ERROR` is returned only for commands the dispatcher itself
rejects (unknown `bRequest`, or a wValue-only SET sent as a SET-type frame
instead of a GET-type frame). A client that needs positive confirmation
should follow the SET with the matching GET and compare; this readback
contract is the same one USB hosts use (see the write-to-readback map in
`Documentation/commands.md`).

### 5.2 Flash-blackout caveat

Any command that writes flash (preset save/load/delete, device-global saves,
factory reset, an interface config SET, DAC-mute config, a bulk apply that
persists) triggers a ~45 ms window with interrupts disabled on the core. During
that window:

- **UART:** inbound bytes can be dropped; a request sent into the window may be
  lost or mangled.
- **I2C:** an in-flight transaction can stall until the window ends.

External hosts should use generous per-request timeouts (hundreds of ms) and
retry. Prefer not to pipeline a flash-writing command immediately behind another
request.

### 5.3 Pin-collision model

The rule is uniform with the rest of the firmware's pin management:

- A **disabled** interface holds no pins. Turning an interface off frees its GPIOs
  for outputs, RX, MCK, or the other control interface.
- **All validation happens at enable/apply time** (or at boot bring-up). A config
  is checked for valid mux functions and for collisions against every other pin
  consumer before the peripheral is brought up.
- A **live** UART or I2C interface reserves its TX/RX or SDA/SCL pins: they
  participate in the firmware's `is_pin_in_use` check, so any other pin-assignment
  command (output pin, RX pin, MCK pin, DAC-mute pin, or the other control
  interface) that targets a live control pin is rejected with
  `PIN_CONFIG_PIN_IN_USE`.
- A persisted config whose pins **collide at boot** (because the output wiring now
  occupies them) leaves that interface **down**: it does not start and is visible
  as `*_live == 0` via `REQ_GET_CTRL_IFACE_STATUS` (`0xF9`) even though its stored
  `enabled` is 1. Re-run the USB config, or free the conflicting pin, to bring it
  up.

Because a SET reconfiguration tears the interface down before validating the new
pins, moving an interface from one valid pin pair to another does not
false-trigger a self-collision.

### 5.4 Factory-reset survival

The interface configs are device-level, stored in the preset directory (V6),
alongside the DAC-hardware-mute config. Like that config, they **survive a factory
reset**: a DSP factory reset does not wipe device-level wiring. To return the
interfaces to their disabled defaults, write disabled configs over USB.

## 6. Worked Examples

Common request/response bytes for setting and reading the master volume
(`REQ_SET_MASTER_VOLUME` = `0xD2`, `REQ_GET_MASTER_VOLUME` = `0xD3`). The payload
is a 4-byte IEEE 754 single-precision dB value, little-endian. For these examples
`wValue = 0x0000` and `wIndex = 0x0000`.

Target value: **-20.0 dB**. As little-endian float: `00 00 A0 C1`.

### 6.1 UART: set master volume to -20.0 dB

```
Host -> device (SET request):
  A5 01 D2 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 A0 C1 CF 6D
   |  |  |  |___ wValue=0  |___ wIndex=0  |___ wLen=4  |____payload____|  |__CRC16 LE
   |  |  |__ bReq = 0xD2
   |  |__ type = 0x01 (SET)
   |__ sync

Device -> host (SET response, OK):
  A5 81 00 00 00 4C 2F
   |  |  |  |___ len = 0   |__ CRC16 LE
   |  |  |__ status = 0x00 (OK)
   |  |__ type = 0x81
   |__ sync
```

### 6.2 UART: read master volume back

```
Host -> device (GET request, cap response at 4 bytes):
  A5 02 D3 00 00 00 00 04 00 B0 EB
   |  |  |  |___ wValue=0  |___ wIndex=0  |___ wLen=4 (cap)  |__ CRC16 LE
   |  |  |__ bReq = 0xD3
   |  |__ type = 0x02 (GET)
   |__ sync

Device -> host (GET response, OK, 4-byte payload = -20.0 dB):
  A5 82 00 04 00 00 00 A0 C1 AB 91
   |  |  |  |___ len = 4   |____payload____|  |__ CRC16 LE
   |  |  |__ status = 0x00 (OK)
   |  |__ type = 0x82
   |__ sync
```

### 6.3 I2C: set master volume to -20.0 dB

```
Host write to target address (SET request, 12 bytes):
  01 D2 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 A0 C1
   |  |  |___ wValue=0  |___ wIdx=0  |___ wLen=4  |____payload____|
   |  |__ bReq = 0xD2
   |__ type = 0x01 (SET)

Host read from target (after dispatch):
  00 00 00  FF FF ...
   |  |___ len = 0   |__ padding
   |__ status = 0x00 (OK)

  If read too soon (before the main loop dispatched):
  01 00 00     (BUSY; retry the read)
```

### 6.4 I2C: read master volume back

```
Host write to target address (GET request, 8-byte header):
  02 D3 00 00 00 00 04 00
   |  |  |___ wValue=0  |___ wIdx=0  |___ wLen=4 (cap)
   |  |__ bReq = 0xD3
   |__ type = 0x02 (GET)

Host read from target (after dispatch):
  00 04 00 00 00 A0 C1  FF FF ...
   |  |___ len = 4   |____payload____|  |__ padding
   |__ status = 0x00 (OK)

  A read landing in the BUSY window returns 01 00 00; retry.
```
